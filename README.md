Back story:
-------
<br/>

  >I recieved a text today informing me of a natural disaster that occurred in the Philippines.
  >This news is relavent to me because one of my best friends just moved to the Philippines. Upon
  >hearing the news, I immediately googled the disaster and, I also googled mapped the major impact area
  >with reference to where my friend lives so I could get a sense of the probability of her home being
  >a disaster area. 
  
  <br/>
  
  >I have not heard from my friend, however, after looking at a mapping of the disaster areas, I am 
  >convinced that she is alright. After I calmed down, I immediately got angry at myself for not knowing of the 
  >natural disaster and I decided to never let something as big as a natural disaster that can harm my
  >friends go unforseen again.

 App: Friends First

 <br/>

>I used Facebook's graph API to create a database of my friend's hometowns and current living locations. 
>I then crossed referenced that information with articles of a website dedicated to reporting natural 
>disasters (http://www.theguardian.com/world/natural-disasters) and created a list of friends who's
>hometowns or current living locations are in predicted and/or current disaster areas. I then 
>I use the Sendgrid API to send an email to myself that has a list of my friends' names, the location
>in question, a snippet of the article on the natural disaster, and a url to the page of the article.

Future plans:
-----------
* Create a CRON job so the script runs on a set time schedule.
* Expand my friend database
